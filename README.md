 
 # 🚀 **Algorithmic Trading with AI: Predicting AAPL Stock Prices** 📉📊

Welcome to my **Algorithmic Trading** project, where I have implemented advanced **machine learning models** to predict the stock prices of **Apple Inc. (AAPL)**. This project utilizes **CNN**, **LSTM**, and **Prophet** models to provide high-accuracy stock price predictions, with a focus on optimizing trading strategies using **AI**.

---

### 🔧 **Technologies Used**:
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow** 🤖
- **Keras** 🔥
- **Prophet** 📅
- **Scikit-learn** 📚
- **Matplotlib** 📈

---

### 📊 **Models Implemented**:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Used for feature extraction from time-series data.
- **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)**: Ideal for capturing temporal dependencies in stock data.
- **Prophet**: Baseline forecasting model for comparison.

---

### 🔍 **Project Highlights**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaled and transformed AAPL stock data using **MinMaxScaler** to improve prediction accuracy.
- **LSTM Performance**: Achieved the **lowest MSE** among all models, making it the most suitable model for **time-series forecasting**.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Visualized predictions vs actual values for a clearer understanding of model performance.
